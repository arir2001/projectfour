# Project Four: Full-Stack Web Application: Anna Rooney Coaching

## Overview

This project is a Full-Stack web application developed using the MVC framework. The application includes a blog, testimonials, comment sections, inquiry form and front-end admin features. The development process followed Agile methodologies, ensuring iterative progress and continuous improvement through regular feedback.

## Design
A pinterest was set up to inspire the design of the website, which you can view [here](https://ie.pinterest.com/23annarooney/anna-website/). The mood of the website was strong female entreperneur.

Then Figma was used to design the layout and stylings. You can view the design [here]([https://github.com/NielMc/django_blog](https://www.figma.com/design/oDYCdAq0j987KhdHqZX7iE/anna-coaching?node-id=0-1&t=xUBvgB8R1oULULuY-1)). The idea was to have a home page, about me page, about you page (services) and a content page with links to youtube, blog and other content. The final design ended up being simpler, with just a home page, inquire page, blog page, login/out/register page, and for the super users, an admin page.

### Difference between my project and Code Institute's

As there are quite a few similarities between this project and Code Institute's upon which this is based, here is a detailed break down of what I added: 
#### **1. Project Structure**
- **This Project's (`projectfour`)**:
  - **File**: `models.py` (in `blog, home` apps)
    - Models: `Post`, `Comment`, `Testimonial`
    - difference:  `Testimonial` model and more detailed user authentication with role-based access control.
  - **File**: `views.py` (in `blog` app)
    - Handles CRUD operations for posts, comments, and testimonials.

- **Reference Project (`django_blog`)**:
  - **File**: `models.py` (in `blog` app)
    - Models: `Post`, `Comment`
    - Simpler structure focusing mainly on posts and comments.
  - **File**: `views.py` (in `blog` app)
    - Basic blog functionality without additional models like `Testimonial`.

#### **2. Models Comparison**
- **Post Model**:
  - Both projects use a `Post` model with similar fields (`title`, `content`, `author`, `created_at`, `updated_at`).

- **Comment Model**:
  - Both projects include a `Comment` model associated with `Post` and CRUD abilities. 

- **Testimonial Model**:
  - **My Project**:
    - `Testimonial` model (not present in `django_blog`):
      - Fields: `user`, `content`, `approved`, `created_at`.
      - **File**: `models.py` (in `home` app).
      - Adds a layer for user-submitted testimonials, managed by admins.
  - **Reference Project**:
    - Does not include this model.

#### **3. Views Comparison**
- **My Project**:
  - Manages posts, comments, and testimonials with separate views. Admin functionality is more developed with additional views for managing testimonials.
  - **Files**: `views.py` (in `blog` app).
- **Reference Project**:
  - Focuses on simpler blog post and comment views without additional admin features or testimonial management.
  - **Files**: `views.py` (in `blog` app).

#### **4. Features**
- **My Project**:
  - **Added Features**: Testimonial submissions, role-based access control, admin dashboard.
  - More complex interactions, allowing admins to moderate comments and testimonials.
- **Reference Project**:
  - Basic blog and comment features without the additional layers of user roles or testimonials.

### Summary of Differences
My project extends the functionality of the reference project by adding a `Testimonial` model, role-based access control, and enhanced admin features. The reference project is simpler, focusing primarily on the blog and comment system without these additional features. 

My project has a more comprehensive structure and user interaction model, but it doesnâ€™t include a `Reply` model as I previously mentioned. My apologies for that error. Instead, my key differentiator is the inclusion of testimonials and more robust user roles.
